Optimized conductance model to calculate gas exchanges in a leaf (H2O, CO2, and COS).
State variables were determined by optimizing the model using experiments dartaset.

The model is for the article "Leaf-level gas exchange experiments indicate a compensation point for carbonyl sulfide"
The model calculates fluxes and mole fractions of H2O, CO2, and COS for several layers inside a leaf.
This code is based on Python 3.
